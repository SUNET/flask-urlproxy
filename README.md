### URLProxy 2.0 for Mailfilter-ng

"URLProxy" was a feature in CanIt-Domain-PRO email filtering software,
that handles rewritten (proxied) URLs in emails that had been rewritten
(based on rules of the CanIt-Domain-PRO system).
The rewritten URLs would take the users to an URLProxy landing page,
with some basic information around the original URL, like:
hosting domain, country etc.

This simple web-app is a free-standing 2.0 version for Mailfilter-ng.
